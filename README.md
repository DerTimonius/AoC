# Advent of Code 2023

This repo holds my attempts of solving the 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles.
My goal is to do this in Rust.

I never did Advent of Code. I'm very new to Rust. What could possibly go wrong?

The structure will be one subdirectory per day.

## To Revisit and Refactor

Some solutions should be revisited at some point
